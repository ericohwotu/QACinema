                Cinemas in the United Kingdom are only permitted to supply tickets to see a 12A film to children under
                the age of 12 if they are accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over. However, it is unlikely to be
                suitable for children under the age of 12.</p> <br>
              <h5 class="card-title">Guidelines:</h5>
              <p class="card-text">May contain mature themes, discrimination, soft drugs, moderate language, moderate
                violence, sex references and nudity. Sexual activity may be briefly and discreetly portrayed. Use of
                strong language may be permitted based on frequency and how they are used, as well as contextual
                justification. Sexual violence may be implied or briefly indicated.</p>

                Hard drugs are generally allowed, and explicit sex references along with detailed sexual activity are
                also allowed. Scenes of strong real sex may be permitted if justified by the context (Sex works
                cannot be placed at "18"). Very strong, gory, and/or sadistic violence is usually permitted. Strong
                sexual violence is permitted unless it is eroticized or excessively graphic, in which a work will
                require compulsory cuts where possible.</p>
